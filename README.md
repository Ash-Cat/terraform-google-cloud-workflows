# terraform-google-cloud-workflow

This module was generated from [terraform-google-module-template](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-module-template/), which by default generates a module that simply creates a GCS bucket. As the module develops, this README should be updated.

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:

- Create a GCS bucket with the provided name

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "cloud_workflow" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/cloud-workflow/google"
  version = "~> 0.1"

  project_id  = "<PROJECT ID>"
  bucket_name = "gcs-test-bucket"
}
```

Functional examples are included in the
[examples](./examples/) directory.
